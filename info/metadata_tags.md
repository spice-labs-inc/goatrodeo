# Metadata Tags

Attaching metadata to a processed file can be useful for categorizing and searching for particular patterns across data sets.
As such, it's useful to have a standard set of names for the tags that are associated with a piece of metadata.

There are challenges in doing this because different metadata providers can disagree on the names of metadata tags as well as the semantics of the metadata and the formatting of the actual data. It should be understood that goat rodeo doesn't have direct control over every metadata provider and that there will be differences in any of names/semantics/formatting. New providers should try to provide as many of these pieces of metadata.

Standard tags are defined in MetadataKeyConstants
