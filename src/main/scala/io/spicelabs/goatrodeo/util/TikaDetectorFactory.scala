// notes:
// if you want to hook into tika's detection process you either need to statically create
// an xml configuration file and reference a jar with your detector(s) in it, or you
// can grab the detectors from TikaConfig and embed it and your detectors into a single
// CompositeDetector. This advice to do this came from here: https://user.tika.apache.narkive.com/iqudHf8O/add-custom-mime-type-programmatically
// which was 11 years old when I found it, so clearly not a lot is going on to improve things.
//
// The CompositeDetector is constructed from a java.util.List of Detector objects.
// The detection process works like this:
// The output MediaType is assumed to be an octet stream
// Each detector gets an oppotunity to run on the input stream and either returns a MediaType of the detected
// stream, or it returns MediaType.OCTET_STREAM.
// If the returned media type is a specialization of the current output MediatType, it will replace the
// current. Therefore, when crafting our own set of detectors the order may very well matter.
// Further, there may be an OverrideDetector in the mix that uses the metadata parameter to detect
// to set how the output should be set.

// TikaDetectorFactory is a simple class to aggregate a set of detectors that are broken into 3 categories:
// firstResponders - a list of detectors to run before the Tika detector
// tikaDetector - a detector grabbed from the TikaConfig object
// finalResponders - a list of detectors to run after the Tika detector

// Where to put a detector is going to depend upon how you're detecting. If for example, you are specifically doing a
// specialization of something that was detected previously, it would make sense to put it in the finalResponders.
// If you are doing a stand-alone detection with high confidence of true positive and true negative, it should go in
// the firstResponders.

// It wasn't clear to me in designing this how it will be configured and used, so I made it thread-safe and written
// such that the toDetector method is cached and any subsequent invocations of toDetector() won't interfere with previous
// invocations.
